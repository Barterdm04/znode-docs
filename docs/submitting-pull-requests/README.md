# Submitting Pull Requests

While developing on Znode, there may be a couple of different scenarios in which an Amla partner wishes to suggest changes to the core Znode libraries:

1. A functional change may be desired to support additional use cases.
1. A bug may be discovered in the platform. If a fix is found, the fix may be submitted to Amla for integration with the official codebase.

Znode's GitHub repositories are relatively new. Best practices to provide efficient collaboration between Amla and partners are still being determined. Until these processes are further developed, please follow GitHub's guide on [submitting pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) to request code changes if desired.
